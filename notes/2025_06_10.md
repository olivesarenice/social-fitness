# Developer Log: Advanced Social Features & RPC Refactoring

**Date:** June 10, 2025 (Evening Session)
**Session Goal:** Evolve the application by implementing core interactive features (Home Feed, Follower Lists, Settings Management) and refactoring all data-mutating logic to be handled by secure, server-side RPC functions.

### Overview of Today's Accomplishments

Today, we transitioned the application from a foundational structure into a feature-rich, secure, and highly efficient social platform. We systematically replaced all remaining client-side data mutations with robust PostgreSQL functions (RPCs), ensuring business logic and validation now live securely on the server. We built out the main activity feed, added interactive social features to the profile page, and created a fully functional, RPC-based settings page.

## 1. The `HomePage` Activity Feed

Our first major task was to build the application's main activity feed.

### 1.1. Backend: The `get_home_feed` RPC

We designed and built a single, powerful RPC function to act as the engine for the entire feed. This approach is massively more performant than trying to assemble the feed on the client.

**Key Features of the `get_home_feed` function:**
* **Complex Joins:** It performs all necessary `JOIN`s on the server across the `activities`, `profiles`, `goals`, and `activity_reference` tables to collect all required information in one query.
* **Core Feed Logic:** It uses a `WHERE` clause to correctly filter activities, showing posts from the current user **OR** from users they have an `accepted` follow relationship with.
* **Scalable Pagination:** The function accepts `page_limit` and `page_offset` parameters, allowing the client to fetch the feed in manageable chunks, ensuring the app remains fast even with thousands of posts.

```sql
-- The core query logic inside get_home_feed
SELECT a.id, p.username, ar.activity_label, g.goal_description, ...
FROM public.activities a
JOIN public.profiles p ON a.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN public.goals g ON a.goal_id = g.id
LEFT JOIN public.activity_reference ar ON a.activity_id = ar.id
WHERE
    a.user_id = auth.uid() OR a.user_id IN (
        SELECT followed_id FROM public.follows
        WHERE follower_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'accepted'
    )
ORDER BY a.timestamp DESC
LIMIT page_limit OFFSET page_offset;
```

### 1.2. Frontend: The `HomePage` Component

We built the `HomePage.jsx` component to consume this RPC.
* It calls `get_home_feed` to load the initial set of activities.
* It features a "Load More" button that increments a `page` state, calling the RPC again with a new offset to fetch and append the next set of activities, creating an "infinite scroll" experience.
* We also fixed a minor dependency issue by running `npm install date-fns` to handle user-friendly date formatting.

## 2. Advanced `ProfilePage` Features

We significantly enhanced the `ProfilePage` to make it more interactive and align with modern social app standards.

### 2.1. Adding Social Counts & Mutuals

We updated the primary `get_profile_by_username` RPC to be even more powerful. It now pre-calculates and returns:
* `follower_count`
* `following_count`
* `mutual_followers_count`

The mutual followers count was efficiently calculated in the database using a SQL `INTERSECT` query, which finds the common users between the viewer's follow list and the profile's follower list. This avoids sending large lists of users to the client just to get a count.

### 2.2. Building the Follower/Following Modals

To power the clickable stats, we created two new, specialized RPC functions:
* **`get_profile_followers`**: Fetches a paginated list of a profile's followers.
* **`get_profile_following`**: Fetches a paginated list of users a profile is following.

The key innovation in these functions is that they **also return `viewer_follow_status` for each user in the list**. This allows the UI in the modal to correctly show whether the viewer is already following, has a pending request with, or can follow each person in the list.

## 3. The `SettingsPage` Overhaul

We refactored the entire settings page to move its logic to the server, closing security loopholes and simplifying the client code.

### 3.1. Securing Profile Updates with RPCs

We replaced the direct client-side `.update()` and `.upsert()` calls with a suite of secure RPCs:
* **`get_settings_data`**: Fetches the logged-in user's profile securely.
* **`check_username_availability`**: A dedicated function for the debounced username check.
* **`update_profile_settings`**: The main update function. Critically, it performs its own **final, authoritative username check** inside the database transaction, preventing any race conditions where a username could be taken between the client's check and the final save.

### 3.2. Implementing the Privacy Toggle

We made the "Make Profile Public" toggle fully functional.
* We created a new RPC, **`update_privacy_setting`**, which takes a boolean and updates the `is_public` flag for the current user.
* On the client, we added state to manage the toggle and implemented an "optimistic update" in the `handlePrivacyToggle` function. The UI updates instantly, and the change is then sent to the server. If the server call fails, the UI reverts to its original state.

## 4. Advanced RPC Data Shaping

In our final step, we further refined the `get_profile_by_username` RPC.
* We modified the queries that bundle the `active_goals` and `activity_log` arrays.
* By adding a `JOIN` to the `activity_reference` table *within* the `jsonb_agg` queries, we enriched the returned JSON, so each goal and activity object now includes its human-readable `activity_label` and `activity_class`. This removes the need for the client to do any mapping or extra lookups, providing the UI with data that is perfectly ready to be rendered.
