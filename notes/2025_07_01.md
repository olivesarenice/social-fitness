This document summarizes the key changes introduced in the latest commit.

## New Features

### 1. First-time User Help Popup

A new feature has been implemented to display a help popup for new users on their first login.

-   **`src/components/AuthForm.jsx`**: Sets an `isNewUser` flag in `localStorage` upon successful sign-up.
-   **`src/App.jsx`**: Checks for the `isNewUser` flag on sign-in and triggers the display of the help popup.
-   **`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`**: Renders the `GameMechanicsPopup` when a new user logs in for the first time.
-   **`src/components/GameMechanicsPopup.jsx`**: A new, multi-page popup that provides a comprehensive guide to the app's features.

### 2. Follow Requests

A follow request system has been added to enhance the social aspect of the application.

-   **`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`**: A "Follow Requests" button and modal have been added, allowing users to manage incoming follow requests.

### 3. Level Up and Confetti

The user experience has been enhanced with visual feedback for leveling up.

-   **`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`**: A confetti effect and a "Level Up" popup are now displayed when a user levels up.
-   **`src/pages/LogActivityPage.jsx`**: The server now informs the client when a user has leveled up after logging an activity.

## UI/UX Improvements

-   **Iconography**: The application now uses icons from the `lucide-react` library for a more consistent and modern look.
-   **Modal Popups**: Standard browser alerts have been replaced with custom modal popups for a more integrated user experience. This change affects the activity logging and settings pages.
-   **Profile Page**: The profile page has been redesigned for clarity and simplicity.
-   **Informational Sections**: The `HomePage` now includes several informational sections to explain the core game mechanics.

## Code Refinements

-   **`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`**: The code has been refactored to use more modular and reusable components for popups and modals.
-   **`src/pages/LogActivityPage.jsx`**: The activity logging process has been improved to provide better feedback to the user.
